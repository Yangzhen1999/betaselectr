# betaselectr: Do selective standardization in structural equation models and regression models

(Version 0.0.1.12, updated on 2024-10-29, [release history](https://sfcheung.github.io/betaselectr/news/index.html))

It computes Beta_Select, standardization
in structural equation models with only
selected variables standardized. It
supports models with moderation, as well
as regression models. It can form
confidence intervals that takes into
account the standardization
appropriately.
